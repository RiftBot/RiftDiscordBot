# Riftbot - Discord Bot 🤖

Riftbot is an open source discord bot written in discord.py. Later the bot will have many features like moderation! But remember this bot is only a Work In Progress so there will be some bugs that will need to be fixed. ⚠

## Configuration

### Default configuration

```py
token = "ENTER TOKEN HERE"
```

### Info

Change the configuration to have the bot function how you need it.

The configuration will be updated to have more things to select from! 😉

## Install Guide

1.Download python [here][DownloadPython]!

2. Create a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal][DiscordDeveloperPortal]!

3. Go to the bot section of the application and create a new bot. Don't forget to pick a neat name for him!

4. Copy the bot's token and paste it into the configuration's `token = ""` part.


That's it! You just need to run the bot.py file and you are now running Riftbot! 🎉🎉🎉


There are no known bugs for now since the project had started not long ago. ⌚
